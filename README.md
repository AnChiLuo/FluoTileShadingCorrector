# FluoTileShadingCorrector
The grid-like shading artifact is a common problem in whole slide images(WSIs), arising from uneven illumination or sample surface irregularities. Affected by this artifact, WSI displays brightness discontinuities and grid-like patterns, which not only degrade visual quality but also ncomplicates downstream image analysis tasks .  Prospective shading methods have been widely used on camera-based imaging systems, but they require a clean, empty field reference image‚Äîwhich is often impractical for fluorescence-labeled tissue sections‚Äîand generally fail on laser‚Äêscanning confocal microscopes because the shading pattern varies dynamically per tile. 
To overcome these challenges, we incorporated [BaSiC](https://imagej.net/plugins/basic)‚Äîa robust retrospective shading method that estimates background variation directly from the data itself, without requiring any reference image. 
However, using BaSiC in practice poses two technical challenges:
   1. Input formatting: BaSiC expects a well-structured image stack, requiring users to manually prepare and rearrange the output stack for the downstream stitch process.
   2. Post-correction stitching: Users must manually stitch corrected tiles to reconstruct a seamless mosaic image.
To streamline this workflow, we present IHC-TileShadingFix, an ImageJ tool that integrates:
   ÔÅ¨	Tile-aware BaSiC flat-field correction (no reference image required),
   ÔÅ¨	Metadata-based tile positioning extracted directly from OME-XML,
   ÔÅ¨	Automatic dataset.xml generation for BigStitcher compatibility,
   ÔÅ¨	Seamless tile stitching and fusion, either in batch or interactive mode.
   

## Feature
This tool provides:
- Supports multi-tile **Zeiss CZI** image import via Bio-Formats
- Automatic reorganization of tile images into BaSiC-compatible format
- Applies **BaSiC flat-field and dark-field correction** tile-wise
- Automatically creates compatible XML for **BigStitcher**
- Removes temporary files to keep workspace clean

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
This tool is implemented as a Groovy script designed to run in  [Fiji (ImageJ)](https://fiji.sc), with dependencies on the following components:

### Requirements
-Fiji with the following plugins installed:
- [Bio-Formats](https://imagej.net/plugins/bio-formats) (bundled with Fiji)
- [BaSiC plugin](https://imagej.net/plugins/basic) (available via Fiji update site)
- [BigStitcher plugin]((https://imagej.net/plugins/bigstitcher/) (available via Fiji update site)

### Setup Instructions
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open Fiji.
3. Open the script:
   - `File > Open` and select `FluoTileShadingCorrector.groovy`
4. Run the script:
   - `Run > Run` or use `Ctrl+R` (‚åò+R on macOS)

Once launchched, a dialog will prompt for a `.czi` file and guide you through the shading correction and stitching process.

## Step-by-step demo
 1. **Luanch the script** in Fiji.
    A dialog window will appear prompting you to(see Fig. 1):
    - **Select file (.czi)** : Browse and choose your raw tile image file.
    - **Reference channel for stitching** : Enter the index of the channel to be used for sititching consistency.
    - **Mode for Runing**:
      - `Automatic` : Performs BaSiC correction and  Grid/Collection Stitching in one go.
      - `Manual` : Pause after stitching to allow user inspection before proceeding to the next channel.

      *Fig. 1: Dialog window for selecting input file, reference channel, and run mode.*

 2. The script will generate three output folders:
    - `BasicTemp` : restructured raw images for BaSiC.
    - `StitchTemp` : Per-tile images corrected by BaSiC.
    -  `Results` : Final fused images
      These folders are created under a parent directory automatically named after the source file.
 3. When finished, only the final fused images in the Results folder are retained.
 4. If  `Manual` mode is selected, a dialog will appear after stitching to allow the user to inspect the fused image (see Fig. 2). You can zoom and pan the image to check the stitching alignment. Options are provided to either proceed to the next channel,rerun BaSiC + Stitching for the same channel, or cancel the process.

## üîç Notes

- üì¶ Input must be **unstitched** CZI files with positional metadata.
- ‚õî **Avoid spaces** in filenames and paths.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Final stitched intensity values are **not calibrated for quantification** due to brightness normalization.
